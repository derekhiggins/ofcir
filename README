ofcir - Organiser  for CI Resources

A CI resource is a resource (only baremetal hosts for now) used by openshift CI,
each resource is defind in Openshift as a Custom Object.

Resources are provided by equinix, but other providers can be added in
future, possible providers would be (ironic, beaker, ibmcloud etc..). A
dummy provider is also provided for testing

Provider data is held in tthe secret "ofcir-secrets" and has the format
data:
  equinix_apitoken: <base64encodedapitoken>
  equinix_project: <base64encodedprojectid>

To Deployment
> bash deploy.sh

To request a CIR a HTTP POST can be used (no parameters needed yet, but may be needed int he future)
> curl -fX POST https://ofcir.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org/ofcir

To release a CIR a HTTP Delete can be used, includeing the CIR name
> curl -fX DELETE https://ofcir.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org/ofcir/cir-2

Once a CIR is released it will be cleaned  (most of the logic can be found in ofcir/handlers.py)




TODO:
  o ibmcloud provider
  o ironic provider
  o remove hardcoded namespace (openshift-machine-api)
  o auth on API
  o uuid returned by POST should be used for DELETE
  o will Need to revisit the resource states and how they work after a trial
  o Once happy with the logic write in Go if preformance is a problem
